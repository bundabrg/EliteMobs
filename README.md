# EliteMobs

This is the GitHub project for the Minecraft plugin EliteMobs (Spigot page can be seen here: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/elitemobs.40090/)

Feel free to check the source code and do any edits you might deem necessary for your own servers.

At this time, I am not interested in accepting contributions to the code. This is my first project of this dimension, and I'd like to have all components of it be written by me.

That being said, I am deeply interested in any suggestions, be they for improving existing features or creating new ones.

# There's a wiki, it has a few entries, if you want more info maybe try reading it.

# //TODO: add description of features and how they work, some day, maybe
